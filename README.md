# Requirements

## Use an All-In-One package

All-in-one packages are available for Windows which contain Apache, PHP, MySQL, and many other dependencies in a single installation file such as XAMPP, WampServer and LAMP.

## Database Configuration
Launch your server then go to your **phpmyadmin** page in your browser then setup your database like below.

Fisrt you need to create **GRH** DataBase,
```
CREATE DATABASE GRH;
```
then create the main tables. 
We have **Users** table for login
```
Users(numUser int Primary Key Auto Increment, login varchar(100), password varchar(32),type
enum(’AD’,’US’));
```
**NOTE:** create the users you want to login with.

and define services in the **Services** table
```
Services(numServ int Primary Key Auto Increment, designationServ varchar(100), descriptionServ
varchar(100));
```
end last you need to create **Employes** table
```
Employes(code int Primary Key Auto Increment, nom varchar(100), prenom varchar(100), sexe enum(‘M’ ;’F’),
adresse text, dateNaissance date, numServ int foreign Key References Services(numServ) );
```
